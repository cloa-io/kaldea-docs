## Getting ready

Discuss how you will set up your organization within Kaldea. Follow instructions
to set up policies and configurations detailed below. Since it is an initial set
up, you can always change it later.

## Establishing best practices for your organization

### Policies for _labels_

Labels can be created and added to resources in accordance to their importance
and domain.

- Governance management becomes easier when labels reflect table management
  policies for governance critical tables such as fact tables and dimension
  tables.
- We recommend that you distinguish main tables by naming them with identifiable
  prefixes (i.e. fct, dim) and create and add labels to the aforementioned table
  and related resources.

### Policies for _Workspace_

Discuss how your organization will set up folders and organize resources in
workspace.

## Details

### Labels

Use labels to categorize resources. Create labels to help organize resources in
your team. You can filter by label when sifting through search results to help
you find resources you need.

For more information, refer to this document:
[Adding labels to categorize resources](https://www.notion.so/Adding-labels-to-categorize-resources-6b11333560b54ed3bc0be9a48161ba0a)

### How to use

Create labels:

- **By level of importance and access level:**
  - Tier 1
  - Tier 2
- **By domain:**
  - Ad
  - Media
- **By operation:**
  - Stg
  - Prod

## Groups

Set granular permissions for different groups and teams by creating groups and
granting them different levels of access for every resource.

### How to use

- Go to Profile > Settings > Group to create and manage groups.

## Workspace

There are 3 types of workspaces in Kaldea: `Public`, `Shared`, `Private`. Each
workspace can hold folders and pages. You can also add shortcut links to tables.

### Public workspace

- Any page under the `Public` heading of your sidebar can be seen by all members
  of your organization. Any authorized user who has `Can edit` or greater access
  can edit resources in the public workspace. By default, organization `admin`s
  are given `Full access` to any page found in this space.

### Shared workspace

- Any pages that you’ve shared with only select individuals and groups will
  appear under `Shared` spaces.

### Private workspace

- Every user’s workspace comes with a `Private` section for organizing their own
  resources. Anything you add here can’t be seen by other members in your
  organization.
