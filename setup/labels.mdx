labels in the Add label flow.

### Edit or delete labels

Go toÂ Profile > Settings > Labels and then hover over the label name to bring up
the option to edit or delete labels. Deleting labels is not reversible. If a
label is in use, you'll still be able to delete the label and doing so will
remove it from any resources.

picker.
