/>
Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Account` ‚Üí `Notifications` to enable notifications for email
and Slack. Options for Slack will be configurable once integration has been enabled.

Customize when you want to receive notifications, such as when you have been
invited to a dashboard or when a table that you are watching becomes outdated.

## üì∏ Improvements to query result snapshot configurations

Previously, the query results of individual query editor blocks in pages were stored in Kaldea's S3 if you had enabled the feature using the "enable query snapshot" toggle after query execution.

You can now set up query results to be stored by default in Query settings. Supported storage destinations include Kaldea's S3 and BigQuery.

If you are an admin, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `General` to enable or disable query result
snapshot for your organization.

Choose storage destinations for each data source.
If you choose to store it in a storage destination other than Kaldea‚Äôs S3, you must
set up storage limitations.

## üìå Introducing Dashboard

Create and share dashboards to allow members of your organization to easily view and analyze data in a visual format.

To create a dashboard, navigate to the section where you want to create the dashboard
and click on `+ Add a dashboard`, just as you would create a page.

Add page shortcuts, textbox, or charts to the dashboard by clicking `+ Add card`. Click `Save` to save
changes once you are done.
