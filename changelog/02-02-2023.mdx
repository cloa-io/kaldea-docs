## ü¶æ Next-level Query Editor

We have released the new Query Editor. Here are the features you can look forward to:

### üóÇÔ∏è Tabs in Query Editor

With the new query tab feature, you can easily open new query tabs and switch back and forth between different queries.

You can also open query tabs in split view. This feature comes in handy when comparing the results of two queries, especially when you are using a laptop and do not have the luxury of two monitors.

### üìä Chart has come to Query Editor

Previously, charts were only available in Query Editor blocks in `Workspace` -> `Pages`. You can now create chart visualizations in Query Editor too.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Query snippet

Query Snippets serve as templates that you can inject into your queries. They are useful for important or commonly used SQL code.

Use the **‚åò+‚áß+S** on Mac or **ctrl+Shift+S** on Windows to save code from query editor as a query snippet.

Use the `/` shortcut to reference and insert snippets into your editor.

### ‚úèÔ∏è UDF: User Defined Functions for BigQuery

We're excited to announce that our Query Editor now supports user-defined functions (UDFs) for BigQuery. UDFs are custom functions that can be used to transform data and perform more complex calculations. This makes it easier to create complex queries and can also help to reduce the amount of code needed to perform the same operation. Additionally, UDFs can provide added flexibility and control over the data returned from a query.

You can use the `:` shortcut to quickly reference and insert user-defined functions (UDFs) into your editor.

## üè† Saved Query has a new home

Saved Query now lives inside `Query`. Click on the list icon to view a list of **Saved Queries** and **Query Snippets**.

## Connect to üêò PostgreSQL, üê¨ MySQL in Kaldea

Our list of integrations is growing! We are excited to announce that we have now added **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** as new datasources. You can now connect to PostgreSQL and MySQL and pull data directly to the Catalog. You can also query your data with SQL within pages or using our powerful _Query Editor_.

With these new datasources, users can access even more data and quickly generate powerful queries. We hope this will help you to make your data analysis and reporting even easier.
