## 🔌 Embedding blocks in Pages

Switching between dozens of browser tabs and multiple apps on your computer can be very challenging. In Kaldea, teams can embed and connect to other apps within Kaldea pages - from Google spreadsheets to Looker dashboards. Spend less time context-switching and enjoy the benefits of having all the resources your team relies on in one place.
