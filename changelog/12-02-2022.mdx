## 🌍 Regional expansion for speed and compliance

We've expanded regional selections!
Now, you can choose between North America (specifically the US) or APAC, whichever is the most appropriate for you. It's always possible to create a new account if your current account isn't in the region you want.

## 🌐 Separate URLs for tabs in Catalog tables

We've created separate URLs for tabs in Catalog tables - schema, lineage, wiki, frequently joined tables, related saved queries, preview, and related pages. You can now share exact tab views with other organization members.
