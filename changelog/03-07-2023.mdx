## üîó Snippet dependency

CTE (common table expression) dependency is essential to know when querying because it helps identify the relationships between CTEs and can improve the efficiency of database queries.

To view upstream and downstream dependencies of CTEs in a given query statement,
press on the **Dependency** tab in the Snippet sidebar.

When dealing with complex queries that have web-like CTE dependencies, it is impossible
to modify select CTEs and partially execute them in order to evaluate changes. However,
this can be done in Kaldea‚Äôs **Snippet Dependency** tab.
