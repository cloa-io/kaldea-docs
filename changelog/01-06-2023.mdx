## üéÆ Introducing command palette

Some of you may have noticed that Kaldea had a command palette prior to this
post. But we're officially announcing it today.{" "}

Kaldea's Command Palette comes with over 50 app actions, which let you access all
of Kaldea‚Äôs core functionality in seconds and discover useful features or shortcuts
you might have missed.

Access the Command Palette with the `Cmd` `K` (Mac) or `Ctrl`
`K` (Windows) keyboard shortcut. You can navigate your entire organization using
the Command Palette:

You can run the most frequent actions you take in Kaldea without ever leaving your keyboard. Like adding a filter to your saved query list. Here's how that looks in practice:

## üíÉüï∫ Real-time collaboration on pages

Multiple people can see and edit the same page at the same time. You can see which teammates are working on what because their avatars will appear next to any block they click on.
