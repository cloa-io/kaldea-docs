### 1. More chart types

We've added horizontal bar, area, big number, and combined charts.![](/changelog/images/12-7-2022/2.png)_\* To visualize your data as combined charts, add multiple y-axes as different chart types_

### 2. Use color to visually group your data

Make your data really stand out with colors!![](/changelog/images/12-7-2022/3.png)

### 3. Time units for charts with column type `Date`

You can now group time units by Year, Quarter, Month, Week, Day, Date, Hours, and Minutes.![](/changelog/images/12-7-2022/4.png)

### 4. Sorting by ascending or descending value

Sort the chart's x-axis by ascending value or descending value.<br />![](/changelog/images/12-7-2022/5.png)

### 5. Aggregation has finally come to charts

Once you add a column to an axis, you can apply aggregation functions. Generally, we support aggregation by **Count**, **Max**, or **Min**. You can use aggregation by **Average** or **Sum** if the column type is integer, float, or time.![](/changelog/images/12-7-2022/6.gif)

### 6. More control over configurations

With this chart update, you have more control over configuration details such as value, legends, axes labels, etc.![](/changelog/images/12-7-2022/7.png)

## ðŸ¤© Popularity scoring

Too much assets making you dizzy? Don't worry, we've got you covered.
You can now order assets by their popularity amongst your team. Save time sifting through assets using popularity scoring to sort through long lists of pages, tables, and saved queries.

_\* Popularity scorings in catalog tables are calculated by their query run frequencies and view counts. Popularity scorings in saved queries and workspace pages are calculated by their view counts._
