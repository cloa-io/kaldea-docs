The data processed by Kaldea includes the following:

- Query Execution History
- Query execution results for visualization: query is executed against customer
  data source, not on Kaldea
- Kaldea user activity
- Customer-managed and controlled access credentials to the data source
- Metadata (e.g. table schema): non-row-level, non-sensitive metadata only

### What kind of security measures are in place

We practice all security measures specified on our SOC-2 compliance report.

In essence, we have security measures in the following categories:

- Physical Security
- Logical Access
- Computer Operations
- Change Control
- Data Communications

PII control: we inherit the data source settings (through the credentials)

### What other compliance on top of SOC2 is in place? or in plan?

We have GDPR in the closest plan with the highest priority.
