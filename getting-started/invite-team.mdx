There are 3 types of ACL levels in Kaldea:

- **Admins:** Organization Admins can manage everything in Kaldea from settings
  to security, members to groups. Think of them as the primary administrator of
  Kaldea with the most expansive permissions.
- **Authors:** Can create and edit resources.
- **Viewers:** Can only access resources as viewers. Cannot create or edit.

### Adding members via email

- Go to `Profile` at the top right of your GNB.
- Click `Settings` and then the `Members` tab.
- Click `+ Invite member` and type the email address of the person you want to
  add.
- Select whether to add them as an `Admin`, `Author` or `Viewer` from the
  dropdown, then press `Send Invite`.
- Invitees will receive an email with a link to sign in and join your workspace.
