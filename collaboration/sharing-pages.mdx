## Share menu

Use the Share menu in the upper right of your pages to manage access control for
a page. A page can be shared with individuals, a group of users, or widely with
the web.

- Each row in this menu represents a different person or group of people you can
  share the page with. In the share menu above:
  - `Kaldea` is an example of a team member with full access to the page. They
    can make edits to the page, delete it and invite additional people.
  - `Share to web` is turned off, so only you and members of your organization
    can see this page.
  - `Copy link` copies the page’s unique URL to your clipboard so you can share
    it with whoever you want. Still, only people with access to the page can see
    it.
  - `Invite` lets you add people or groups in your organization using their
    username.

## Share with members in your organization

You can share pages with everyone in your organization via public spaces, which
all organization members are added to automatically. By default, Admins of an
organization are given full access to public pages while Authors and Viewers of
an organization have view access to public pages.

- Create a page in public space in your sidebar. Hover over public space and
  click the `+` button that appears.
- Drag a page to public space in your sidebar. This automatically shares it with
  everyone.

## Publish page to web

To make page viewable as a site on the web or to share it with people who don’t
use Kaldea, you can turn on `Share to web`. Anyone with the link will be able to
see it.

### Instructions for making pages public:

- Click on Share at the top right of the page you want to publish to the web.
- By default, the access level next to `Share to web` will be `No access`.
- To publish you page to the web, turn on `Share to web` access.
- Click `Copy link` to copy the page’s unique URL to share.
- Only people with the page’s unique URL will be able to see it.
